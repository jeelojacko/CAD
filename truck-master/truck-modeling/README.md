Integrated modeling algorithms by geometry and topology

## Sample Codes

### bottle

Modeling a bottle.

This is a technical indicator for comparing with Open CASCADE Technology, a great senior.
We want to reproduce the bottle made in the [OCCT tutorial].
Now, one cannot make a fillet or run boolean operations by truck.
So, the bottle made by this script is not completed.

Generated json file can be visualized by `simple-shape-viewer`, an example of `truck-rendimpl`.
